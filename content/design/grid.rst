Introduction
============

In the NWP and climate modelling community (as opposed to, for instance, the engineering
community) the grid is often a fixed property for a model.
One of Atlas' goals is to provide a catalogue of a variety of global and regional grids defined by the World Meteorological Organisation in order to support multiple models and model inter-comparison initiatives.


There exist three main categories of grids in terms of functionality that Atlas can
currently represent: unstructured grids, regular grids, and reduced grids.


Unstructured grids describe an arbitrary number of points in no particular order.
The ``x``- and ``y``-coordinates of the points cannot be computed with certain mathematical formulations, and thus have to be specified individually for each point (e.g. \refFigure{unstructured-grid}). 


Regular grids on the other hand make the assumption that points are aligned in both ``x``- and ``y``-direction (e.g. \refFigure{regular-grid}). 
Grid point coordinates can then be derived by two independent
indices (``i``, ``j``) associated to the ``x``- and ``y``- direction, respectively.


For reduced grids, lines of constant ``y`` or so called parallels may however
have a different amount of gridpoints along the ``x``-direction (\refFigure{structured-grid} and \refFigure{structured-O16-grid}). Reduced grids are a common type of grid employed in global weather and climate models to reduce the number of points towards the poles
in order to achieve a quasi-uniform resolution on the sphere.


For both regular and reduced grids, no assumptions are made on the spacing between the parallels
in the ``y`` direction. The points in ``x``-direction on every parallel are assumed to be equispaced.


Atlas provides grid construction facilities based on a configuration object of the type \class{Config}
to create global grids or regional grids.
For most global grids, this configuration object can also be inferred from a simple string identifier or \emph{name}
containing one or more numbers representing the grid resolution. Commonly used global grids that can
currently be accessed through such name are:

- regular longitude-latitude grid  (name: ``L<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``L<N>``);
- shifted longitude-latitude grid  (name: ``S<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``S<N>``);
- regular Gaussian grid (name: ``F<N>``);
- classic reduced Gaussian grid (name: ``N<N>``);
- octahedral reduced Gaussian grid (name: ``O<N>``).

In the identifiers shown in this list, ``<NLON>`` stands for the number of longitudes, ``<NLAT>`` for the number of latitudes, and ``<N>`` for the number of parallels between the North Pole and equator (interval :math:`[90^\circ, 0^\circ)` ). These grids will be explained in more detail following sections.

Projection
==========

In order to support regional grids for the Limited Area Modelling (LAM) community,
projections are often needed that transform so called grid coordinates (``x``, ``y``)
to geographic coordinates (longitude,latitude).
For regional grids, the grid coordinates are often defined in meters on a regular grid, as is the case for e.g. a Lambert conformal conic projection and a 
Mercator projection. Another example projection that is also applicable to a global grid is the Schmidt projection.

In Atlas, the projection is embodied by a :dox:`Projection` class, illustrated in \refFigure{grid-Projection}.
It wraps an abstract polymorphic \class{ProjectionImplementation} class with currently 6 concrete implementations:

- :dox:`LonLatProjection` ( type: ``lonlat``, units: ``degrees``, identity )
- :dox:`RotatedLonLatProjection` ( type: ``rotated_lonlat``, units: ``degrees`` )
- :dox:`SchmidtProjection` ( type: ``schmidt``, units: ``degrees`` )
- :dox:`RotatedSchmidtProjection` ( type: ``rotated_schmidt``, units: ``degrees`` )
- :dox:`MercatorProjection` ( type: ``mercator``, units: ``meters``, regional )
- :dox:`RotatedMercatorProjection` ( type: ``rotated_mercator``, units: ``meters``, regional )
- :dox:`LambertAzimuthalEqualAreaProjection` ( type: ``lambert_azimuthal_equal_area``, units: ``meters``, regional )
- :dox:`LambertConformalConicProjection` ( type: ``lambert_conformal_conic``, units: ``meters``, regional )

The :dox:`Projection` furthermore exposes functions to convert ``xy`` coordinates to ``lonlat`` coordinates and its inverse.

Domain
======

In this section, the :dox:`Domain` class is introduced (\refFigure{grid-Domain}). Its purpose is only useful for non-global grids, and
can be used to detect if any coordinate (``x``, ``y``) is contained within the domain that envelops the grid. 
The design follows the same principle as the :dox:`Projection`: the :dox:`Domain` class wraps an abstract polymorphic
:dox:`DomainImplementation` class with currently 3 concrete implementations:

- :dox:`RectangularDomain` ( type: ``rectangular`` )
- :dox:`ZonalBandDomain` ( type: ``zonal_band``, units: ``degrees`` )
- :dox:`GlobalDomain` ( type: ``global``, units: ``degrees`` )

.. TODO
    \begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/grid/Domain.pdf}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`Domain` class }
    \label{figure:grid-Domain}
    \end{figure}

.. note-info ::

    The domain has no knowledge of any grid projection. Therefore the points that can be tested to 
    be contained inside the domain must be provided in grid coordinates (``x``, ``y``), 
    and not in geographical coordinates (``lon``, ``lat``).

The :dox:`RectangularDomain` domain defines a rectangular region defined by 4 values: :math:`x_\mathrm{min}`, :math:`x_\mathrm{max}`, :math:`y_\mathrm{min}`, :math:`y_\mathrm{max}`. These values must be defined in units that correspond to the used grid projection. The :dox:`ZonalBandDomain` domain assumes that the units of ``x`` and ``y`` are in degrees, and that the domain is periodic in the ``x``-direction. Therefore, to test if a point is contained within this domain only requires to check if the point's ``y`` coordinate lies in the interval :math:`[y_\mathrm{min} , y_\mathrm{max}]`. The :dox:`GlobalDomain` domain, like the :dox:`ZonalBandDomain` domain assumes units in degrees, and always evaluates that any point is contained within.

Supported Grid types
====================

Atlas provides a basic :dox:`Grid` class that can embody any unstructured, regular or reduced grid.
The :dox:`Grid` class is a wrapper to an abstract polymorphic \class{GridImplementation} class with 2 concrete implementations:
\class{Unstructured} and \class{Structured}. The \class{Unstructured} implementation holds a list of (``x``, ``y``) coordinates (one pair for each grid point). The 
:dox:`Structured` implementation follows the assumption of a reduced grid. It holds a list of ``y``-coordinates (one value for each grid parallel), a list of number 
of points for each parallel, and a list of ``x``-intervals (one pair for each parallel) in which the points for the parallel are uniformly distributed. With the :dox:`Structured` implementation, both reduced and regular grids can be represented, as regular grids can also be interpreted as a special case of a reduced grid (where every parallel contains the same number of points).

Following code snippets shows how to construct any grid from either a configuration object or a *name*, both in C++ and Fortran.

.. block-warning:: Example on construction of grids

    C++ example:

    .. code:: cpp


        Config F16_config;
        F16_config.set( "type", "regular_gaussian" );
        F16_config.set( "N", 16 );
        
        Grid F16( F16_config );   // regular Gaussian grid (F16)
        Grid N16( "N16" );        // classic reduced Gaussian (N16)

    Fortran example:
    
    .. code:: fortran

        type(atlas_Grid)   :: F16, N16
        type(atlas_Config) :: F16_config
        ...
        F16_config = atlas_Config()
        call F16_config%set( "type", "regular_gaussian" )
        call F16_config%set( "N", 16 )

        F16 = atlas_Grid( F16_config )  ! regular Gaussian grid (F16)
        N16 = atlas_Grid( "N16" )       ! classic reduced Gaussian grid (N16)

    .. note-success::

        Even though the configuration object (``F16_config``) is here constructed programatically,
        it may also be imported through a JSON string or file. 
        The regular Gaussian grid could also be constructed through a name ``F16``.
        Similarly the classic reduced Gaussian grid could also be constructed through a config
        object with the type ``classic_gaussian``.

\refFigure{grid-Grid} illustrates the :dox:`Grid` class implementation. It shows that the :dox:`Grid` class can
return instances of the :dox:`Domain` class and the :dox:`Projection` class.

.. TODO
    \begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/grid/Grid.pdf}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`Grid` class }
    \label{figure:grid-Grid}
    \end{figure}

Because this basic :dox:`Grid` class can make no assumptions on whether it wraps a \class{Structured} or a \class{Unstructured} concrete implementation, it can only expose an interface for the most general type of grids: the \class{Unstructured} approach. This means that we can find out the number of grid points with
the :dox:`Grid::size()` function, and that we can iterate over all points, assuming no particular order. The following C++ code 
shows how to iterate over all points, and use the projection to get longitude-latitude coordinates.

.. code:: cpp

    // Iterating over all points of a octahedral reduced Gaussian grid O1280

    Grid grid( "O1280" );
    Log::info() << "The grid contains " << grid.size() << " points. \n";
    for( PointXY p, grid ) {
        Log::info() << "xy: " << p << "\n";
        double x = p.x();
        double y = p.y();
  
        PointLonLat pll = grid.projection().lonlat(p);
        Log::info() << "lonlat: " << pll << "\n";
        double lon = pll.lon();
        double lat = pll.lat();
    }

.. note-info ::

    In above C++ code we used the projection to compute the longitude and latitude coordinates.
    For the used octahedral Gaussian grid however, the projection is of the ``lonlat`` type by
    construction, meaning that ``x`` and ``y`` are already equivalent to ``lon`` and ``lat`` respectively.
    The second part in the for loop was thus not necessary for this particular grid.

The basic :dox:`Grid` class shown in \refFigure{grid-Grid} also exposes a function :dox:`Grid::uid()` which returns
a string which is guaranteed to be unique for every possible grid. This includes differences in projections and domains 
as well.

To be able to expose more structure or properties present in the grid, a number of ``grid interpretation`` classes are 
available, that also wrap the used \class{GridImplementation}, but try to cast it to the \class{Structured} implementation if necessary. Currently available interpretations classes are:

- :dox:`UnstructuredGrid`: The grid is unstructured and cannot be interpreted as structured.
- :dox:`StructuredGrid`: The grid may be regular or reduced.
- :dox:`RegularGrid`: The grid is regular.
- :dox:`ReducedGrid`: The grid is reduced, and *not* regular.
- :dox:`GaussianGrid`: The grid may be a global regular or reduced Gaussian grid.
- :dox:`RegularGaussianGrid`: The grid is a global regular Gaussian grid.
- :dox:`ReducedGaussianGrid`: The grid is a global reduced Gaussian grid, and \emph{not} a regular grid.
- :dox:`RegularLonLatGrid`: The grid is a global regular longitude-latitude grid.
- :dox:`RegularPeriodicGrid`: The grid is a periodic (in ``x``) regular grid.
- :dox:`RegularRegionalGrid`: The grid is a regional non-periodic regular grid, and can have any projection.

Note that there is no use case for interpreting a grid as e.g. ``octahedral reduced Gaussian`` or ``classic reduced Gaussian``,
as it does not bring any benefit over the :dox:`ReducedGaussianGrid` interpretation class.

Just like the basic :dox:`Grid` class, these interpretation classes have a function :cpp:`valid()`. Rather than throwing errors or aborting the program if the constraints listed above are not satisfied, the user has to call
the :cpp:`valid()` function to assert the interpretation is possible.
\refFigure{grid-Tree} illustrates the above list schematically. Arrows indicate a ``can be interpreted by`` relationship.

    \label{figure:grid-Tree}
    \end{figure}

.. note-info::

    For a NWP model, you can usually safely assume the grid interpretations as
    the model can usually only
    work with a certain type of grid. ECMWF's IFS-model for instance, can assume that all used grids
    can be interpreted by the :dox:`GaussianGrid` class, whereas a LAM-model could e.g.
    assume the :dox:`RegularRegionalGrid` interpretation.

UnstructuredGrid
----------------

The :dox:`UnstructuredGrid` interpretation class constrains the grid implementation to be \class{Unstructured}. No assumption on any form of structure can be made. Also no assumption on the domain nor the projection used is made. 

\refFigure{grid-UnstructuredGrid} shows the UML class diagram of the :dox:`StructuredGrid`. The first two constructors listed effectively create a new grid, whereas the third constructor accepts any existing grid, and reinterprets it instead. No copy or extra storage is then introduced, since the wrapped :dox:`GridImplementation` is a reference counted pointer (a.k.a. ``shared_ptr``), of which the reference count is increased and decreased upon :dox:`UnstructuredGrid` construction and destruction respectively.

    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`UnstructuredGrid` class }
    \label{figure:grid-UnstructuredGrid}
    \end{figure}

An :dox:`UnstructuredGrid` exposes two extra functions :dox:`UnstructuredGrid::xy(n)` and :dox:`UnstructuredGrid::lonlat(n)`. The first function
gives random access to the (``x``, ``y``) coordinates of grid point ``n``. The second function is a convenience function that internally uses the grid :dox:`Projection` to project the grid coordinates `xy(i, j)` to geographic coordinates.



.. _structuredgrid:

StructuredGrid
--------------

The :dox:`StructuredGrid` interpretation class constrains the grid implementation to be \class{Structured}. The grid may 
be regular or reduced. It makes no assumptions on whether the domain is global, periodic, or regional, or whether any 
projection is used. Almost any grid with some form of structure in a single area can therefore be interpreted by this 
class.

\refFigure{grid-StructuredGrid} shows the UML class diagram of the :dox:`StructuredGrid`. The first two constructors listed effectively create a new grid, whereas the third constructor accepts
any :dox:`Grid`, and reinterprets it instead if possible. No copy or extra storage is then introduced, since the wrapped \class{GridImplementation} is a reference counted pointer (a.k.a. :cpp:`shared_ptr`), of which the reference count is increased and decreased upon :dox:`StructuredGrid` construction and destruction respectively.

.. TODO
    \begin{figure}[htb!]

    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`StructuredGrid` class }
    \label{figure:grid-StructuredGrid}
    \end{figure}

With the information that the grid can only be reduced or regular, new accessor functions can be exposed
to access grid points more effectively through indices (``i``, ``j``). The only functions that can be guaranteed to 
apply for both regular and reduced grids, are the ones that assume a reduced grid. This means that the ``x`` coordinate
and the number of points on a parallel depend on the parallel itself, denoted by index ``j``.
For convenience, a function ``lonlat(i, j)`` is available that internally uses the grid :dox:`Projection`
to project the grid coordinates ``xy(i, j)`` to geographic coordinates.


RegularGrid
-----------

A :dox:`RegularGrid` is a specialisation of a :dox:`StructuredGrid` by further constraining that the number of points on every parallel is equal. In other words, points are now also aligned in ``y`` direction. The grid then forms a Cartesian coordinate system.

With this information, access to the ``x`` coordinate of a point is now independent of the index ``j``, and only depends on the index ``i``. The relevant functions that can be adapted now are :dox:`RegularGrid::nx()` and :dox:`RegularGrid::x(i)`. Using these functions can possibly increase the performance of algorithms.

    \label{figure:grid-RegularGrid}
    \end{figure}


ReducedGrid
-----------

A :dox:`ReducedGrid` is, unlike the :dox:`RegularGrid`, not a specialisation of the :dox:`StructuredGrid` in terms of functionality, but it does add the constraint that the grid is only valid when it is not regular.
\refFigure{grid-ReducedGrid} shows the class diagram for this type of grid.

    \label{figure:grid-ReducedGrid}
    \end{figure}


GaussianGrid
------------

A :dox:`GaussianGrid` is a :dox:`StructuredGrid` with the additional constraint that the grid is globally defined with an even number of parallels that follow the roots of a Legendre polynomial in the interval :math:`(90^\circ,-90^\circ)` \cite{Hortal1991}.
This class exposes an additional function :dox:`GaussianGrid::N()`, which is the so called Gaussian number, equivalent to the number of parallels between the North Pole and the equator. The ``x``-coordinate of each first point of a parallel starts at :math:`0^\circ` (Greenwich meridian). \refFigure{grid-GaussianGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`GaussianGrid`.

    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`GaussianGrid` class }
    \label{figure:grid-GaussianGrid}
    \end{figure}

RegularGaussianGrid
-------------------

A :dox:`RegularGaussianGrid` combines the properties of a :dox:`RegularGrid` and a :dox:`GaussianGrid`.
It can be defined by a single number ``N`` (the Gaussian number). The number of points in ``x``- and ``y``-direction are by convention
\begin{align*}
nx &= 4 N  \\
ny &= 2 N  
\end{align*}
\refFigure{grid-RegularGaussianGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`RegularGaussianGrid`.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/grid/RegularGaussianGrid.pdf}
\caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`RegularGaussianGrid` class }
\label{figure:grid-RegularGaussianGrid}
\end{figure}
As can be seen in the class diagram, an additional constructor is available, taking only this Gaussian number ``N``, so that it is easy to create grids of this type. These grids can also be created through the constructor taking the name ``F<N>``, with ``<N>`` the Gaussian number ``N``.


ReducedGaussianGrid
-------------------

A :dox:`ReducedGaussianGrid` combines the properties of a :dox:`ReducedGrid` and a :dox:`GaussianGrid`.
A single number ``N`` (the Gaussian number), defines the number of parallels (``ny = 2 N``), but no assumptions are made
on the number of points on each parallel.

\refFigure{grid-ReducedGaussianGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`ReducedGaussianGrid`.

.. TODO
    \begin{figure}[htb!]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/grid/ReducedGaussianGrid.pdf}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the :dox:`ReducedGaussianGrid` class }
    \label{figure:grid-ReducedGaussianGrid}
    \end{figure}

As can be seen in the class diagram, an additional constructor is available, taking an array of integer values with size equal to the number of parallels (must be even). The values correspond to the number of points for each parallel. The WMO GRIB standard also refers to this array as ``PL``, and IFS refers to this array as ``NLOEN``. In Atlas it is referred to as the array ``nx`` (cfr. the :dox:`StructuredGrid`). The number of parallels ``ny`` is inferred by the length of this array, and the Gaussian ``N`` number is then ``ny/2``, which is used to define the ``y``-coordinate of the parallels.

Classic reduced Gaussian grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In practise we tend to use only a small subset of the infinite possible combinations of reduced Gaussian grids for a specific ``N`` number. Until around 2016, ECMWF's IFS-model was using reduced Gaussian grids for which the ``nx``-array was not straightforward to compute. These arrays for all used reduced Gaussian grids were tabulated. We now refer to these grids as ``classic`` reduced Gaussian grids, and they can be created through the name ``N<N>``, with ``<N>`` the Gaussian number ``N``. Not any value of ``N`` is possible because there are only a limited number of such grids created (only the ones used). Atlas can create classic reduced Gaussian grids for values of ``N`` in the list [ 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128, 160, 200, 256, 320, 400, 512, 576, 640, 800, 1024, 1280, 1600, 2000, 4000, 8000 ].

Octahedral reduced Gaussian grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since around 2016, ECMWF's IFS-model now uses reduced Gaussian grids for which the ``nx``-array can be computed by a simple formula rather than a complex algorithm. These grids are referred to as ``octahedral`` reduced Gaussian grids. The ``nx``-array can be computed as follows in C++:\\

.. code:: cpp

    // Computing the `nx`-array for octahedral reduced Gaussian grids, C++ example,
    int jLast = 2*N-1;
    for( int j=0; j<N; ++j ) {
      nx[j] = 20 + 4*j;    // Up to equator
      nx[jLast-j] = nx[j]; // Symmetry around equator
    }

In order to refer to these grids easily in common language, and to more easily construct these grids using the constructor taking a name, the name ``O<N>`` was chosen, with ``<N>`` the Gaussian number ``N``, and ``O`` referring to ``octahedral``. The term ``octahedral`` originates from the inspiration to project a regularly triangulated octahedron to the sphere. Few modifications to the resulting grid were made to make it a suitable reduced Gaussian grid for a spectral transform model \cite{malardel2016new}. 

.. note-danger::

    Models or other software applications should not treat the octahedral reduced Gaussian grid as a special case.
    For all means and purposes it is still a reduced Gaussian grid, following all requirements layed out by the WMO GRIB standard! 


RegularLonLatGrid
-----------------

The :dox:`RegularLonLatGrid` is likely the most commonly used grid on the sphere. It is a global grid regular grid defined in degrees with a uniform distribution both in ``x``- and in ``y``-direction. Atlas supports 4 variants of the :dox:`RegularLonLatGrid`, each with 2 identifier names:
\begin{itemize}
\item standard: ``L<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``L<N>``
\item shifted: ``S<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``S<N>``
\item longitude-shifted: ``Slon<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``SLON<N>``
\item latitude-shifted: ``Slat<NLON>x<NLAT>`` or ``SLAT<N>``
\end{itemize}
In the identifier names, ``<NLON>`` and ``<NLAT>`` denote respectively ``nx`` and ``ny`` of a regular grid. For ease of comparison with the Gaussian grids, these grids can also be named instead with a ``N`` number denoting the number of parallels in the interval :math:`[90^\circ,0^\circ)` -- between the North Pole and equator by including Pole and excluding equator. The ``x``- and ``y``-increment is then computed as :math:`90^\circ/N`.
For each of the grids, all points are defined in the range :math:`0^\circ \leq x < 360^\circ` and :math:`-90^\circ \leq y \leq +90^\circ`.
For the \emph{standard} case, the first and last parallel are located exactly at respectively the North and South Pole. Usually the number of parallels ``ny=<NLAT>`` is odd, so that there is also exactly one parallel on the equator. It is also guaranteed that the first point on each parallel is located on the Greenwich meridian (:math:`x = 0^\circ`).
In this context, \emph{shifted} denotes a shift or displacement of ``x``- and ``y``-coordinates of all points with half increments with respect to the standard (or unshifted) case. In order to achieve the same ``x``- and ``y``-increment as the \emph{standard} case, the \emph{shifted} case should be constructed with one less parallel. The two remaining cases \emph{longitude-shifted} and \emph{latitude-shifted} shift only respectively the ``x`` or ``y`` coordinate of each grid point.

\refFigure{grid-RegularLonLatGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`RegularLonLatGrid`. It can be seen that this class exposes 4 functions to query which of the 4 variants is presented.

RegularPeriodicGrid
-------------------

The :dox:`RegularPeriodicGrid` can be used to assert that the grid is a regular grid with equidistant spacing in ``x``- and ``y``-direction, and with periodicity in the ``x``-direction. The latter enforces an implicit additional constraint that ``x`` and ``y`` are defined in degrees. \refFigure{grid-RegularPeriodicGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`RegularPeriodicGrid`.

RegularRegionalGrid
-------------------

The :dox:`RegularRegionalGrid` is a grid that asserts that the grid is not global nor periodic. The gridpoints must be equidistant both in ``x``- and ``y``-direction. No restrictions on projections are made. This grid would be the typical use-case grid to use in conjuction with e.g. a Lambert, Mercator, or RotatedLonLat projection.
\refFigure{grid-RegularRegionalGrid} shows the class diagram for the :dox:`RegularRegionalGrid`.

Construction of grids of this type can be done in various ways through configuration.


Partitioner
===========

Even though the \class{Grid} object itself is not distributed in memory as it does not have a large memory footprint, it is necessary for parallel algorithms to divide work over parallel MPI tasks.

There exist various strategies in how to partition a grid, where each strategy may
offer different advantages, depending on the grid and numerical algorithms to be used.

Atlas implements a grid \class{Partitioner} class, that given a grid, partitions the grid and creates a \class{Distribution} object that describes for each grid point which partition it belongs to.
\refFigure{grid-Partitioner} illustrates the UML class diagram for the \class{Partitioner} class. Following a similar design philosophy as before, the \class{Partitioner} class wraps an abstract polymorphic \class{PartitionerImplementation} object. \refFigure{grid-Distribution} illustrates the UML class diagram for the \class{Distribution} class.

    \caption{UML class diagram for the \class{Distribution} class }
    \label{figure:grid-Distribution}
    \end{figure}

Currently there are 3 concrete implementations of the \class{PartitionerImplementation}:

- :dox:`Checkerboard` ( type: ``checkerboard`` ) -- Partitions a grid in regular zones
- :dox:`EqualRegions` ( type: ``equal_regions`` ) -- Partitions a grid in equal regions, reminiscent of a disco ball.
- :dox:`MatchingMesh` ( type: ``matching_mesh`` ) -- Partitions a grid such that grid points following the domain decomposition of an existing mesh which may be based on a different grid.
- :dox:`MatchingFunctionSpace` ( type: ``matching_functionspace`` ) -- Partitions a grid such that grid points following the domain decomposition of an existing functionspace which may be based on a different grid.

The \class{Checkerboard} and \class{EqualRegions} implementations can be created from a configuration object only. The \class{MatchingMesh} implementation requires a further mesh argument to its constructor. For this reason, a \class{MatchingMeshPartitioner} class exists whose only purpose is that it knows how to construct its related \class{MatchingMesh} implementation with the extra mesh argument.

Checkerboard Partitioner
------------------------

For regular grids, such as the one depicted
in \refFigure{regular-grid}, a logical domain decomposition would be a checkerboard. The grid is then divided as well as possible into approximate rectangular zones in Cartesian grid coordinates (``x``, ``y``) with an equal number of grid points.
An example of this partitioning algorithm is shown in \refFigure{grid-Checkerboard-example}.

    Example \class{Checkerboard} partitioning of a shifted regular longitude-latitude grid ``S64x32`` in 32 partitions.


EqualRegions Partitioner
------------------------

For reduced grids as the ones shown in \refFigure{structured-grid} and
\refFigure{structured-O16-grid} or for uniformly distributed unstructured grids, an ``equal regions`` domain decomposition is more advantageous
\cite{deconinck2016accelerating,leopardi2006partition,Mozdzynski2007}.
The ``equal regions`` partitioning algorithm divides a two-dimensional grid of the sphere
(i.e. representing a planet) into bands from the North pole to the South pole.
These bands are oriented in zonal directions and each band is then split further into
regions containing equal number of grid points. The only exceptions are the bands containing
the North or South Pole, that are not subdivided into regions but constitute North and
South polar caps.

An example of this partitioning algorithm is shown in \refFigure{grid-EqualRegions-example}

    :target: {static}/design/img/equal-regions-32parts-N16.png
    
    Example \class{EqualRegions} partitioning of a \idx{N16} classic reduced Gaussian grid in 32 partitions.


MatchingMesh Partitioner
------------------------

The \class{MatchingMeshPartitioner} allows to create a \class{Distribution} for a grid such that the grid points follows the domain decomposition of an existing mesh (described in detail in \refSection{mesh}).
This partitioning strategy is particularly useful when grid points of a partition should be contained within a mesh partition present on the same MPI task to avoid parallel communication during coupling or interpolation algorithms. Note that there is no guarantee of any load-balance here for the partitioned grid. \refFigure{grid-MatchingMeshPartitioner-example} shows an example application of the \class{MatchingMeshPartitioner}.

    Example partitioning in 32 parts of a F8 rectangular Gaussian grid (solid dots) using the domain decomposition
    of an existing meshed N24 classic reduced Gaussian grid. Each domain is shaded and surrounded by a solid line.
    The jagged lines of the existing N24 mesh subdomains are contours of its elements.
